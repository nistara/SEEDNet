** notes
- use files names as inputs to the function
- getOption("dir", "dir2") for directory to save results in 
- for data (both in example as well as function definition), consider using: =system.file...=
- sim_output for output directory (to make it explicit)
- consider removing =fxn= from the function names....be less redundant. perhaps use =flunet_sim=
- consider arabic instead of Roman numbers in the function names
- use =message= instead of =cat=....it's explicitly a message, and they can be collected as well as silenced
- don't save files by default - give user the option to return as output, or save file if directory is specified (i.e. it's not empty, =""= or an =NA=). 
  So for e.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
if (length(sim_out) >0 && !is.na(sim_out) {
f = file.path("sample_data", ...., %d%s) sprintf()
saveRDS(..., f[1])
saveRDS)..., f[2])
f
} else {
list(sim = sim, info = info)
}
#+END_SRC
** next steps
- make small data samples and add to =inst/sample_data=
- provide Duncan with link to actual big data
- make ebo-net or rather, disnet!
