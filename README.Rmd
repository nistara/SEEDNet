# SEEDNet

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nistara/SEEDNet.svg?token=NzZHVjGpzy5BDLtSKxLg&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/nistara/SEEDNet)

`SEEDNet` has been designed to simulate outbreaks over a network created
by combining satellite imagery, population data, and road network information. It is versatile in that it can be used for any metapopulation model on networks with distance and population data.
